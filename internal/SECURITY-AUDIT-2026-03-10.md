## SEC-11: Trivy Container Scan Non-Blocking [MEDIUM — New]

**Location:** `.github/workflows/build.yml:257` — `continue-on-error: true`

The Trivy container image scan for `vabamorf-api` is set to `continue-on-error: true`. This means HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities in the Docker image will not block the build or deployment pipeline.

**Risk:** A container image with known critical vulnerabilities could be pushed to ECR and deployed to production without any gate.

**Recommendation:** Remove `continue-on-error: true` or add a separate blocking gate that fails the build on CRITICAL severity while allowing HIGH as warnings.

---

## SEC-12: npm Dependency Vulnerabilities [MEDIUM — New]

**Location:** `pnpm-lock.yaml` — transitive dependencies

`pnpm audit` reports 24 vulnerabilities:
- **1 critical**: `basic-ftp` path traversal (transitive via serverless)
- **20 high**: `minimatch` ReDoS (8x, via babel-jest/nx/eslint), `underscore` recursion, `rollup` path traversal, `immutable` prototype pollution
- **2 moderate**: (ignored by CI config)
- **1 low**: `fast-xml-parser` stack overflow (via `@aws-sdk`)

**Production impact:** The `fast-xml-parser` vulnerability is the only one in production dependencies (via AWS SDK). All others are in devDependencies (babel-jest, nx, eslint, serverless, rollup). The `basic-ftp` critical is via `serverless` CLI (dev tool, not deployed).

**CI behavior:** `pnpm audit --audit-level=high --ignore-unfixable` runs in CI. Currently passes because unfixable transitive deps are ignored. This is appropriate but should be monitored.

**Recommendation:** Update `serverless` to latest v3 patch (fixes `basic-ftp`). Monitor `fast-xml-parser` for AWS SDK update. Consider `pnpm audit --prod` in CI for stricter production-only checks.

---

## SEC-13: `voice` Parameter Not Validated Against Allowlist [LOW — New]

**Location:** `packages/tts-api/src/schemas.ts:16` — `voice: z.string().optional()`

The `voice` parameter accepts any string value. It is passed to the Merlin TTS worker via SQS and used as a directory name component in the synthesis pipeline. While the worker validates `cacheKey` (hex-only), `speed`, `pitch`, and `text` length, the `voice` value is passed unchecked to the file system.

**Mitigating factors:** The voice value is embedded in a `shlex.quote()`-protected command (worker.py:170), and Merlin will simply fail if the voice directory doesn't exist. No direct path traversal is possible.

**Recommendation:** Add a Zod `.regex()` or `.enum()` constraint to `voice` in `SynthesizeRequestSchema` to restrict to known voice IDs (e.g., `efm_l`, `efm_h`).

---

## SEC-14: ~~No Dependabot~~ — FALSE POSITIVE [Closed]

Dependabot is already configured at `.github/dependabot.yml` with npm, github-actions, and docker ecosystems. Weekly schedule, grouped updates for AWS SDK, testing, and build dependencies.

---

## SEC-15: `pickle.load` Without Integrity Verification [LOW — Accepted]

**Location:** `packages/tts-worker/merlin/run_merlin.py:99`

The Merlin ML model is loaded via `pickle.load()` without SHA-256 verification. Pickle deserialization can execute arbitrary code.

**Mitigating factors:** Model files are baked into the Docker image at build time (not downloaded at runtime). Image uses ECR immutable tags and scan-on-push. The file is in the `merlin/` external library directory — not our code to modify.

**Status:** Accepted. Risk is limited to supply chain attack on the Docker build. ECR scanning provides detection.

---

## SEC-16: `shell=True` in Merlin `generate.py` [LOW — Accepted]

**Location:** `packages/tts-worker/merlin/utils/generate.py:73`

External Merlin library code uses `subprocess.Popen(args, shell=True)`. Our own `worker.py` uses `shlex.quote()` for all arguments passed to subprocess.

**Status:** Accepted. External library code, excluded from Ruff linting. Our wrapper code is safe.

---

## SEC-17: Store `/get-shared` Has No Auth [LOW — By Design]

**Location:** `packages/store/serverless.yml:81-84` — no `authorizer` on `/get-shared` and `/get-public`

The `/get-shared` and `/get-public` endpoints allow unauthenticated GET requests. The handler code (`handler.ts:117-123`) restricts these to read-only access for items with type `shared`, `unlisted`, or `public`.

**Status:** By design. These endpoints serve publicly shareable content. Write operations (`/save`, `/delete`) require auth. CloudFront forwards these routes without `Authorization` header (`locals.tf:61-62`, `auth = false`).

---

## Recommendations

1. **SEC-11** — Make Trivy scan blocking for CRITICAL vulnerabilities. Change `continue-on-error: true` to `false`, or add a second step that fails on CRITICAL only.

2. **SEC-12** — Update `serverless` to latest v3 patch to resolve `basic-ftp` critical. Monitor `fast-xml-parser` for AWS SDK update.

3. **SEC-13** — Add voice parameter validation: `z.string().regex(/^[a-z0-9_]{2,20}$/).optional()` or use `.enum()` with known voices.

4. ~~**SEC-14**~~ — False positive. Dependabot already configured.

5. **DynamoDB encryption** — SimpleStore table uses default AWS encryption. Consider explicit CMK if storing sensitive user data in future.

6. **Container Insights** — ECS cluster has `containerInsights = enabled` ✅. Consider adding Fargate runtime monitoring when AWS makes it available for Spot.
